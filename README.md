## What and why?

Savings Quest is a savings app where parents/guardians can assign their children "quests" to do, such as chores, and then reward them with money and in-app experience points. Caretakers can set the amount of money their kids would be given for completing a quest, and can mark quests as completed increasing their child's in-app money amount, which their child can save up before asking their caretakers to buy them something using the money they have earned. Children and caretakers can also set "journeys" for the child to embark on, which are meant to act as savings goals, which can act as reminders and progress bars for what the child is trying to save up for.

The money earned in Saving Quest isn't meant to be directly given to the child either through cash or an in-app banking service, instead the money amount in the app acts as a counter which the child will then have to redeem from their caretaker, ensuring that they actually try to save and reach their goals instead of just immediately spending their money on whatever they happen to see right after earning some money. This will not only help children learn to save up money, but will also make caretakers more comfortable with letting their kids earn money, since the caretakers can still control what their kids end up spending it on.

## For whom?

This app is primarily targeted for the caretakers of young children, though the app could also be used with older children. It allows for caretakers to teach their children the value of money and how to save, while also allowing them to give their children a list of tasks to do in a form that is engaging for the child, due to the application's game-like feel and appealing UI for children.

By presenting the application as a game where the child can have their customizable avatar go on journeys and complete quests, children will hopefully stay engaged as they feel like they are playing a game while also learning how to save.

## How?

Caretakers will mainly have to set quests for their children. This would be as simple as writing a single sentence of text and attaching an image if wanted. To mark a quest as completed all a caretaker would have to do is open up their childs task list from their caretaker account and press one button to mark it as completed. Caretakers will also have the option to remove money from their child's account to reflect money that they spent.

All children will have to do is look at their task list to see what they have to do, and can mark their quests as ready to be checked by their caretaker. They will also have to option to redeem in-app rewards to customize the appearance of the app and their in-app avatar.

Both parties will also have the option to set up "journeys" for the child. Journeys act as money saving goals which can be accompanied by text or images showing what the child wants to save up for.

The simplicity of the user experience will both make it appealing to caretakers as they don't have to do much, and will keep kids engaged as they won't be confused by complex menus and actions.

## Scope

The base functionality of the application, that being a money tracker which can be increased by the user marking assigned tasks as completed, is rather simple while still being a very useful tool for parents to use with their children.

From there the the focus of the project would shift to making the app more engaging or convenient to use, which could be done in a number of ways such as make the UI more appealing to children and giving the users way to customize their experience, such as through points gained by completing quests, or by adding simple additional functionality like the ability to link "journeys" to live prices in case of sales. These additional features to improve user experience aren't completely vital for the application to still be useful, and as such can be scoped up or down throughout the project while the main functionality can definitely be completed within the time frame.
